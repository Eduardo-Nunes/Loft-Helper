# Loft Helper App
Flutter Project to win LoftTech Hackathon

## Web deploy
Build the app for deployment using the flutter build web command. This generates the app, including the assets, and places the files into the /build/web directory of the project.

Launch a web server (for example, python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000, or by using the [dhttpd](https://pub.dev/packages/dhttpd) package), and open the /build/web directory. Navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser (given the python SimpleHTTPServer example) to view the release version of your app.


A new Flutter project.
